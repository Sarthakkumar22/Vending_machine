# Vending_machine
The "Vending Machine Verilog" project is a digital simulation of a vending machine designed to dispense a 15 Rs water bottle. Developed using popular tools like VSCode, Icarus Verilog, and GTKWave, this project showcases the implementation of a simple yet functional vending machine using hardware description language (HDL) Verilog.
The vending machine is programmed to accept two types of coin inputs: 5 Rs and 10 Rs. The water bottle's price is set at 15 Rs. When a user inputs coins, the vending machine verifies the total amount inserted. Once the total reaches or exceeds the price of the water bottle, the machine dispenses the bottle and calculates the change (if any) to return to the user.

Key Components:

- Verilog HDL: The project leverages Verilog to model the behavior of the vending machine's logic, states, and coin validation.
- VSCode: Visual Studio Code provides a user-friendly integrated development environment for writing, editing, and managing Verilog code.
- Icarus Verilog: This open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool allows for the verification of the vending machine's functionality before real-world implementation.
- GTKWave: GTKWave is used to visualize simulation waveforms, making it easier to debug and analyze the behavior of the Verilog modules.
  
Overall, the "Vending Machine Verilog" project demonstrates the fundamental principles of digital design, state machines, and coin validation in a vending machine context. By utilizing a combination of cutting-edge development tools, this project offers a hands-on learning experience for those interested in digital hardware design and simulation. The code and simulation waveforms provided in the GitHub repository offer an insightful guide to understanding the inner workings of the vending machine's logic.
