The "Vending Machine Verilog" project is a digital simulation of a vending machine designed to dispense a 15 Rs water bottle. Developed using popular tools like VSCode, Icarus Verilog, and GTKWave, this project showcases the implementation of a simple yet functional vending machine using hardware description language (HDL) Verilog.
